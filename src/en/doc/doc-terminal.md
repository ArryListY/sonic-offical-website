#Terminal

Here is an introduction to how to use Terminal.

## android

### Shell

Same as adb shell, you donâ€™t need to enter adb shell when using it, just enter the corresponding command directly. For example:
```bash
wm size
```

### Logcat
Same as adb logcat, you can filter logcat log levels and keywords when using it.

## iOS

### Process

Same as sib ps, display the current real-time running process list.

### SysLog

Same as sib syslog, display current system log.
