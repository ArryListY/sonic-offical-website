# resource management

Manage whether all urls of sonic need to be authenticated, the default is off.
The current mechanism is to check whether the application version needs to be updated after the application is launched. When the application version remains unchanged, it will only be executed once.

## Synchronize resources
1. Go to the home page, click on the user name or avatar to enter the background management center.
2. One click will force statistics of all currently requested urls, which is generally used when the version number is not modified during the development process.

## Whether authentication is required

By default, all urls do not require authentication, which can be customized according to your needs
